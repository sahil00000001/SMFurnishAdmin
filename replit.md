# Overview

This is a full-stack furniture inventory management system called "SM Furnishing" built with React, Express.js, and TypeScript. The application serves as an admin portal for managing furniture products and categories with a modern, responsive UI. It features user authentication, product CRUD operations, category management, and a dashboard with analytics. The system is designed to handle furniture inventory for a business, allowing administrators to track products, manage stock levels, and organize items by categories.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using React with TypeScript and follows a component-based architecture. It uses Vite for development and build tooling, providing fast hot module replacement and optimized production builds. The UI is constructed with shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives, styled with Tailwind CSS for a consistent, modern design system.

The application implements client-side routing using Wouter, a lightweight routing library. State management is handled through a combination of Zustand for global authentication state and TanStack Query for server state management and caching. This approach provides efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization between client and server.

The component structure follows a clear separation of concerns with dedicated directories for UI components, pages, hooks, and utilities. The authentication system uses persistent storage to maintain login state across browser sessions.

## Backend Architecture
The backend is implemented as a RESTful API using Express.js with TypeScript. It follows a clean, modular architecture with separate concerns for routing, data storage, and business logic. The server includes comprehensive request logging middleware that tracks API performance and response data for debugging purposes.

The application supports both in-memory storage (for development) and PostgreSQL database integration through Drizzle ORM. This dual approach allows for easy development and testing while providing production-ready database capabilities. The storage interface pattern ensures the business logic remains database-agnostic.

Authentication is implemented using a simple username/password system with session-based authentication. The API includes proper error handling and validation using Zod schemas for type-safe data validation.

## Database Design
The database schema is defined using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL as the target database. The schema includes three main entities:

- **Users**: Stores admin credentials with unique usernames
- **Products**: Contains comprehensive product information including name, SKU, description, pricing, category assignment, stock levels, status, and timestamps
- **Categories**: Manages product categorization with descriptions and product counts

All tables use UUID primary keys generated by PostgreSQL for better scalability and security. The schema includes proper constraints, default values, and relationships between entities.

## Development Tools and Build Process
The project uses a modern development toolchain with TypeScript for type safety across the entire stack. Vite handles frontend development and building, while tsx provides TypeScript execution for the backend. The build process creates optimized bundles for both client and server components.

ESBuild is used for server-side bundling to create efficient production builds. The development environment includes hot reloading, error overlays, and comprehensive TypeScript checking to ensure code quality and developer productivity.
